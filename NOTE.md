# NOTE
1. I already did npm install clarifai.
2. Because clarifai did updates, I just have to watch the 261st video.
3. Andrei did an update on 262nd video, so I have to watch it too and start to code with that video.
4. I use a deprecated React-particle-js because the latest version didn't work and now they use TsParticles which use TypeScript.
