# NOTE
1. I use a deprecated React-particle-js because the latest version didn't work and now they use TsParticles which use TypeScript.
2. I also use a deprecated Clarifai Javascript version, because the latest version only support using NodeJS, but in this project I don't use it
3. Ignore the eslint file in this project because I accidentally install it.
4. I already put the Model ID and I use Andrei's Model ID because I can't find the same Model ID in the Clarifai website.
5. The Model ID that Andrei gave in Udemy (260nd video) isn't working.
